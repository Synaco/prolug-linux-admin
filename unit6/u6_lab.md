## Pre-Lab Warm-Up

---

Exercises (Warmup to quickly run through your system and practice commands)

1. `cd~`
2. `pwd (should be /home/<yourusername>)`
3. `cd /tmp`
4. `pwd (should be /tmp)`
5. `cd`
6. `pwd (should be /home/<yourusername>)`
7. `mkdir lab_firewalld`
8. `cd lab_firewalld`
9. `touch testfile1`
10. `ls`
11. `touch testfile{2..10}`
12. `ls`
13. `seq 10`
14. `seq 1 10`
15. `seq 1 2 10`
    - man seq and see what each of those values mean. It’s important to know the behavior if you intend to ever use the command, as we often do with counting (for) loops.

No worries, there are two ways to fix the mess you've made.
Nothing you've done is permanent, so logging out and reloading a shell (logging back in) would fix this.  
We just put the aliases back.

16. `for i in `seq 1 10`; do touch file$i; done;`
17. `ls`
    - Think about some of those commands and when you might use them. Try to change command #15 to remove all of those files (rm -rf file$i)

## Lab

---

This lab is designed to help you get familiar with the basics of the systems you will be working on.

Some of you will find that you know the basic material but the techniques here allow
you to put it together in a more complex fashion.

It is recommended that you type these commands and do not copy and paste them.
Browsers sometimes like to format characters in a way that doesn't always play nice with Linux.

#### Check Firewall Status and settings:

A very important thing to note before starting this lab. You’re connected into that server on ssh via port 22. If you do anything to lockout **port 22** in this lab, you will be blocked from that connection and we’ll have to reset it.

1. Check firewall status

   ```bash
   [root@schampine ~]# systemctl status firewalld
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: inactive (dead) since Sat 2017-01-21 19:27:10 MST; 2 weeks 6 days ago
    Main PID: 722 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

   Jan 21 19:18:11 schampine firewalld[722]: 2017-01-21 19:18:11 ERROR: COMMAND....

   Jan 21 19:27:08 schampine systemd[1]: Stopping firewalld - dynamic firewall.....
   Jan 21 19:27:10 schampine systemd[1]: Stopped firewalld - dynamic firewall ...n.
   ```

   **Hint:** Some lines were ellipsized, use -l to show in full.

#### If necessary start the firewalld daemon:

```bash
systemctl start firewalld
```

#### Set the firewalld daemon to be persistent through reboots:

```bash
systemctl enable firewalld
```

Verify with systemctl status firewalld again from **step 1**

#### Check which zones exist:

```bash
firewall-cmd --get-zones
```

#### Checking the values within each zone:

```bash
firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public
```

**General Output**

```bash
public (default, active)
interfaces: wlp4s0
sources:
services: dhcpv6-client ssh
ports:
masquerade: no
forward-ports:
icmp-blocks:
rich rules:
```

#### Checking the active and default zones:

```bash
firewall-cmd --get-default
```

Example Output:

```bash
public
```

Next Command

```bash
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

Example Output:

```bash
public
interfaces: wlp4s0
```

**Note:** this also shows which interface the zone is applied to. Multiple interfaces and zones can be applied

So now you know how to see the values in your firewall. Use steps 4 and 5 to check all the values of the different zones to see how they differ.

#### Set the firewall active and default zones:

We know the zones from above, set your firewall to the different active or default zones. Default zones are the ones that will come up when the firewall is restarted.

**Note:** It may be useful to perform an `ifconfig -a` and note your interfaces for the next part

```bash
ifconfig -a | grep -i flags
```

Example Output:

```bash
[root@rocky ~]# ifconfig -a | grep -i flags
docker0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
ens32: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
```

1.  Changing the default zones (This is permanent over a reboot, other commands require --permanent switch)

```bash
firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=work
```

Example Output:

```bash
success
```

Next Command:

```bash
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

Example Output:

```bash
work
    interfaces: wlp4s0
```

Attempt to set it back to the original public zone and verify.
Set it to one other zone, verify, then set it back to public.

Changing interfaces and assigning different zones (use another interface from your earlier `ifconfig -a`

```bash
firewall-cmd --change-interface=virbr0 --zone dmz
```

Example Output:

```bash
success
```

Next Command:

```bash
firewall-cmd --add-source 192.168.11.0/24 --zone=public
```

Example Output:

```bash
success
```

Next Command:

```bash
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

Example Output:

```bash
dmz
   interfaces: virbr0
work
   interfaces: wlp4s0
public
   sources: 192.168.200.0/24
```

#### Working with ports and services:

We can be even more granular with our ports and services. We can block or allow services by port number, or we can assign port numbers to a service name and then block or allow those service names.

1. List all services assigned in firewalld

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --get-services
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   RH-Satellite-6 amanda-client bacula bacula-client dhcp dhcpv6 dhcpv6-client dns freeipa-ldap freeipa-ldaps freeipa-replication ftp high-availability http https imaps ipp ipp-client ipsec iscsi-target kerberos kpasswd ldap ldaps libvirt libvirt-tls mdns mountd ms-wbt mysql nfs ntp openvpn pmcd pmproxy pmwebapi pmwebapis pop3s postgresql proxy-dhcp radius rpc-bind rsyncd samba samba-client smtp ssh telnet tftp tftp-client transmission-client vdsm vnc-server wbem-https
   ```

   This next part is just to show you where the service definitions exist. They are simple xml format and can easily be manipulated or changed to make new services. This would require a restart of the firewalld service to re-read this directory.

   Next Command:

   ```bash
   ls /usr/lib/firewalld/services/
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   amanda-client.xml        iscsi-target.xml  pop3s.xml
   bacula-client.xml        kerberos.xml      postgresql.xml
   bacula.xml               kpasswd.xml       proxy-dhcp.xml
   dhcpv6-client.xml        ldaps.xml         radius.xml
   dhcpv6.xml               ldap.xml          RH-Satellite-6.xml
   dhcp.xml                 libvirt-tls.xml   rpc-bind.xml
   dns.xml                  libvirt.xml       rsyncd.xml
   freeipa-ldaps.xml        mdns.xml          samba-client.xml
   freeipa-ldap.xml         mountd.xml        samba.xml
   freeipa-replication.xml  ms-wbt.xml        smtp.xml
   ftp.xml                  mysql.xml         ssh.xml
   high-availability.xml    nfs.xml           telnet.xml
   https.xml                ntp.xml           tftp-client.xml
   http.xml                 openvpn.xml       tftp.xml
   imaps.xml                pmcd.xml          transmission-client.xml
   ipp-client.xml           pmproxy.xml       vdsm.xml
   ipp.xml                  pmwebapis.xml     vnc-server.xml
   ipsec.xml                pmwebapi.xml      wbem-https.xml
   ```

   Next Command:

   ```bash
   cat /usr/lib/firewalld/services/http.xml
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <service>
     <short>WWW (HTTP)</short>
     <description>HTTP is the protocol used to serve Web pages. If you plan to make your Web       server publicly available, enable this option. This option is not required for viewing pages locally or developing Web pages.</description>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="80"/>
   </service>
   ```

2. Adding a service or port to a zone

   Ensuring we are working on a public zone

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=public
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Listing Services

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --list-services
   ```

   Example Ouput:

   ```bash
   dhcpv6-client ssh
   ```

   **Note:** We have 2 services

   Permanently adding a service with the `--permanent` switch

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service ftp
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Reloading

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Verifying we are in the correct **Zone**

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   public
   ```

   Verifying that we have successfully added the **FTP** service

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --list-services
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   dhcpv6-client ftp ssh
   ```

   Alternatively, we can do almost the same thing but not use a defined service name. If I just want to allow port 1147 through for TCP traffic, it is very simple as well.

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=1147/tcp
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Reloading once again

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Listing open ports now

   ```bash
   [root@schampine services]# firewall-cmd --list-ports
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   1147/tcp
   ```

3. Removing unwanted services or ports

   To remove those values and permanently fix the configuration back we simply use remove.

   Firstly, we will permanently remove ftp service

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=ftp
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Then we will permanently remove the ports

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=1147/tcp
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Now lets do a reload

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   success
   ```

   Now we can list services again to confirm our work

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --list-services
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```bash
   dhcpv6-client ssh
   ```

   Now we can list ports

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --list-ports
   ```

   Example Output:

   `Nothing`

   Before making any more changes I recommend running the `list` commands above with `>> /tmp/firewall.orig` on them so you have all your original values saved somewhere in case you need them.

So now take this and set up some firewalls on the interfaces of your system.
Change the default ports and services assigned to your different zones (at least 3 zones)
Read the `man firewall-cmd` command or `firewall-cmd -help` to see if there are any other userful things you should know.
