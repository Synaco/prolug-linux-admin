2. Why, as a system administrator and not directly in security, do you think it’s so important to understand how your systems can be attacked? Isn’t it someone else’s problem to think about that?
```text
As a system administrator, more than likely you are charged with the 
responsibility of keeping the systems up and available. Knowing how 
the systems can fail and be attacked would help you in that goal 
regardless of whether there's a separate team in charge of security.
```

3. What impact to the organization is data exfiltration? Even if you’re not a data owner or data custodian, why is it so important to understand the data on your systems?
```text
Data exfiltration has a huge impact on an organizaton. It leads to
loss of reputation and ultimately financial loss for the company. It's
important to understand the data on your systems so that you can add
appropriate security controls in place and to better detect/respond to
incidents when they do occur. 
```

#### Discussion Post #2

Find a blog or article on the web that discusses the user environment in Linux. You may want to search for .bashrc or (dot) environment files in Linux.

1. What types of customizations might you setup for your environment? Why?
- I would setup basic configurations for the tools that I use.  For example I have my .vimrc to add functionality and color to the text editor. It enhances the experience when using said tool/tools.

2. What problems can you anticipate around helping users with their dot files?
- Off the top of my head, everyone's different. The way one person would setup their dot files would be different from someone else. Someone elses environment may be setup completely different from my environment, so things may not work out of the box.
