Next, answer these questions here:

1. What do you hope to learn in this course?
 - I hope to learn enough fundamental skills that would help me get a job in the field. I also hope to learn some of the other fields that exists out there that I may not be aware of.

2. What type of career path are you shooting for?
 - Platform Engineer because Scott said I can watch netflix while doing the job (joking). On a serious note, getting good at building systems that others use sounds rewarding and it seems like in that position you get to learn/know about how many things work at the foundational level.

4. What are you doing to close the gap? What can you do to remedy the difference?


### Start thinking about your project ideas (more to come in future weeks):

Topics:

1. System Stability
2. System Performance
3. System Security
4. System monitoring
5. Kubernetes
6. Programming/Automation

You will research, design, deploy, and document a system that improves your administration of Linux systems in some way.
